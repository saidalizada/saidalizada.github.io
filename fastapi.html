    <h1>FastAPI for Beginners: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. This guide is designed for beginner programmers who want to learn how to build a web API using FastAPI.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>FastAPI is a new, modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It has been gaining popularity due to its fast performance, easy-to-use API, and support for the latest Python features. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, a lightweight asynchronous framework, and Pydantic, a data validation library.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started with FastAPI</h2>
    <p>FastAPI is easy to install and use, making it a great choice for beginners who want to build a web API. To get started, you'll need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer. Then, you can install FastAPI by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>pip install fastapi</code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Your First FastAPI API</h2>
    <p>Once you have FastAPI installed, you're ready to start building your first API. To get started, create a new file called `main.py` and add the following code:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This code creates a new FastAPI app and defines two routes: one for the root of the API, and one for an endpoint that takes in a `item_id` and an optional `q` query parameter.</p>
    <h2>Running the API</h2>
    <p>To run your API, simply run the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>uvicorn main:app --reload</code>
    </pre>
    <p>This will start the API on `http://localhost:8000`. You can visit this URL in your browser to see the output of your API.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>FastAPI is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use web framework for building APIs with Python. It's a great choice for beginners who want to build a web API and for experienced developers who want to build high-performance APIs. With its simple API, fast performance, and support for the latest Python features, FastAPI is a great choice for building a web API.</
